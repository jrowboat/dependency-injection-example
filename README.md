# Dependency injection example

## Motivation
- Create an example of dependency injection from work for discussion in class of what is done well and what can be improved.

## Requirements
- Create a class with dependency injection that mirrors the dominant dependency injection pattern at work

## Desired focus
- Pay attention to the use of dependency injection throughout the file. I am open to other thoughts as well (mostly out of curiosity), but my intent of this example is to focus on how the OrderService class implements dependency injection.

## My questions/curiosities to discuss
- How well is dependency injection done in the example?
- What are the cons of praticing dependency injection in the way the example does?
- What are the concerns that are cared for by dependency injection?
